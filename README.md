# Experiments on Summarization-Driven Book Generation
This repository contains the main components of "Beta Writer", the algorithmic author of [the first machine-generated research book published by Springer Nature](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-16800-1).

## Additional Information

Note that "Beta Writer" has originally been tailored to consume and process Springer custom-specific document type formats ([A++](http://devel.springer.de/A++/V2.4/DTD/)) and does not (yet) support generic PDF.

Currently, we therefore provide only the scripts for major text processing task including:

* Preprocessing (entity masking)
* Document clustering (chapter generation)
* Syntactic restructuring 
* Synonym generation
